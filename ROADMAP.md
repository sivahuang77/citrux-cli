# 🍊 Citrux CLI Roadmap

**Fresh Code, Deep Logic.**

Citrux CLI is an original, intelligent terminal interface designed for modern
developers. This document outlines our vision for the future of Citrux, moving
from a powerful local assistant to a comprehensive development platform.

---

## 📅 Release Milestones

### ✅ v0.1.0: The Awakening (Current)

- **Brand Identity**: Full transition to Citrux CLI (Orange Theme).
- **Dual-Core Architecture**: Gemini internals + Citrux public API for maximum
  stability.
- **Context Manager**: Interactive TUI for managing project context
  (`CITRUX.md`).
- **Multi-LLM Support**: Native adapters for OpenAI, DeepSeek, and Google
  models.
- **Isolation**: Complete separation from Gemini CLI (Env vars, Paths).

### 🚧 v0.2.0: The Cloud Connector (Planned)

- **Citrux Cloud**: One-click deployment tools (`/deploy`).
- **Server Management**: Basic monitoring of remote instances via CLI.
- **Secure Tunnels**: SSH key management and secure transfer protocols.

### 🔮 v0.3.0: The Neural Network (Future)

- **Local RAG**: Vector-based codebase indexing for "whole project" awareness.
- **Extension Marketplace**: CLI-based browser for community extensions.
- **Workflow Automation**: Custom macros and Git hooks.

## 🎯 Strategic Focus Areas

### 1. 🧠 Core Intelligence

We aim to make Citrux the smartest pair programmer by integrating **Local RAG
(Vector Search)**. Instead of manually selecting files, Citrux will eventually
be able to "read" your entire repository to find relevant context automatically.

### 2. 🛡️ Security & Sovereignty

Your code belongs to you. We plan to introduce:

- **Local Key Vault**: Encrypting API keys using system-level keychains.
- **Sensitive Data Scanning**: Proactive warnings if you attempt to paste
  secrets into the chat.

### 3. 🧩 Ecosystem & Extensibility

- **Extension Store**: A centralized (but open) registry for sharing custom
  tools.
- **NPM Distribution**: Making `@citrux/cli` available via standard package
  managers.

## 🤝 How to Contribute

Citrux CLI is open-source. We welcome contributions that align with our "Fresh
Code, Deep Logic" philosophy.

_This roadmap is a living document and will evolve as we squeeze more juice out
of the code._
